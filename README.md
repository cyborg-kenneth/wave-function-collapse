# Wave Function Collapse
A small demo that uses wave function collapse (if I got it right) to procedurally generate terrains. 

This project was made with Godot 4.0.2

I used 4 different tiles: 
- WATER: Can only be next to another WATER tile or a SAND tile
- SAND: Can be next to a WATER tile, a SAND tile, or a GRASS tile
- GRASS: Can be next to a SAND tile, a GRASS tile, or a TREE tile
- TREE: Can be next to a GRASS tile or a TREE tile
